//This is a Dear Diary page that records the types of pictures
//and videos I have taken in a week of my Reading week.

//The data is represented through the form of a musical sheet,
//where notes are mapped based on the type of pictures or videos
//taken, whether they are a picture of food, something interesting,
//or a picture of my friends and I etc. The notes are also mapped
//based on whether it is a picture taken (where the note is a
//crotchet - 1 beat) or a video taken (where the note is a minim - 2
//beats). Similarly, the notes are also mapped based on whether the
//photo/video was taken by a digicam, instead of my phone (where
// a 'tail' is added to the note), and if it was taken by others ,
//instead of by myself (where a dot is added to the side of the note).
//I documented the types of pictures and videos I took through a week
//in a csv file, and I wrote a program that looped through the data
//and hence drawing the musical sheet out.

//Interactive features:
//  Click to jumble - Click your mouse anywhere within the canvas, for
//    the type/category of each note to jumble up, hence causing the
//    musical sheet to change and be remapped accordingly.

//  Magical keyboard - The numbers 1-9 on your keyboard play a
//    different note each (with 1 being the highest note, 2 being
//    the second highest note, and accordingly down the scale, hence
//    with 9 being the lowest note). Use the magical keyboard to play
//    the musical sheet out!
